### Directions
Solve at least 3 of the challenges below. Create a file using the language for your program (`challenge1.rb` or `challenge1.js`) for each of the challenges you select. For each challenge you complete, include comments showing the **overall goal** in your own words, your **pseudocode**, and your **final solution**.

1. Given an array of strings, print only the strings that have exactly 4 characters.
1. Start with an array of strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Print every word in all lowercase letters.
1. Write a method or function that removes all instances of the letter <strong>s</strong> in a string. The method or function should accept a string as an argument and return the same string with every instance of the letter <strong>s</strong> removed.
1. Start with an array of hobbies. Print out only the words that end in "ing".
